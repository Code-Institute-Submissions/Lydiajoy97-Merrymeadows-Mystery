# User-Experience 
Project Outcomes:

To build a game in python and deploy it to Heroku. 
To show my python skills and understanding in creating this game. 

# User-Stories:
I want to play a line terminal game that's fun and engaging and has some user interation. I want it to allow you to think and make choices.

I want to play a simple murder mystrey game that gives me a chance to guess the characters.

I want to be able to recall my suspects which will help me decide who the murderer is. 

# Features 

# Structure-Plan:

# Wireframes 

# Design-and-Color-Scheme

This game is developed as a line based terminal game, so has little desgin features.
One design effect that I would like to have is for the script to be printed with a type writter effect. This will allow the user to feel like the game is happening in real time, and help with overall engagement.

One thing I would like to add as a future development is different color text for each of the characters so that the user can read the script easily and determine what character is talking.

# Testing-and-Results 
Strategy:
1. Test game by playing the game.
2. Test each condition by typing in the wrong answers first. This will check if the while loops are working correctly.
3. Play the game to check that the story moves on without ant error. 
4. Check the most recent version has been pushed to Heroku.
5. Pass through a Python Validator with no errors.

Summary:

Testing Results:

Code was passed through the CI Python Linter validator. 
At first there was issues with white spaces and indentations on most lines. 
All errors were then fixed and it now passes through the Validator.

# Deployment 
This Code is depolyed to Heroku. 
To do this I opened an Heroku account and clicked the add app feature. I then linked the account to my git hub pages and deplyed the game.
